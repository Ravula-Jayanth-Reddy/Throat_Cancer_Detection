# THROAT CANCER DETECTION
Machine Learning model that can accurately detect the presence of throat cancer in patients based on the analysis of their medical records and symptoms. The model should be able to analyze a set of input variables, including age, sex, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, throat pain, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and other relevant medical history, and provide a binary output indicating the likelihood of throat cancer. The dataset used for training and testing the model should be large enough to provide robust results and should be sourced from reliable medical sources. The model's performance should be evaluated 
using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a tool that can aid doctors in making more informed diagnoses and treatment decisions for patients with throat cancer.
